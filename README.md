# roman-gitreactproject
as before Typescript and react app made with create-react-app

you probably don't need all the node modules which I've included, I am using this code as part of a desktop app and am not sure which are/are not neccessary at this point. 

I think youll mostly want to look at SRC for app.js, index.js, and the components folders which you sent me. 

They are rendered inside of index.html which is in the public folder
